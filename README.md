# x-to-twitter
‚ùå Very basic browser extension that changes x.com back to twitter.com

This should work on all Chromium and Firefox based Browsers. Simply clone / download this repo somewhere (it has to be a folder) and load it.

For Firefox, use `about:debugging`. This is just temporary however. Haven't figured out how to permanently install it here.

For Chromium-based, use `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://`, `opera://` etc., turn on Developer Mode there, and use "Load unpacked extension"
